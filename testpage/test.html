    <h1>This is the index page</h1>
    <p>template.html gets processed and makes the base
    of the website.</p>
    <p>Source page is processed with following rules</p>
    <ul>
        <li>head contents are appended into template head</li>
        <li>body contents are appended into template section</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This makes it really easy to keep content and
    layout separate.</p>
